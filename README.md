# RBI_Cash_Demand_Time-Series

• Do ⭐ the repository if it helped you in anyway.

# Data Collection:

Data is published on RBI website.

Source: https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49901

# Future work:

We can extend this model to forecast the cash demand for individual banks. Here, we have the data for ATM withdrawal across bank and so we can forecast the demand in total. However, if an individual bank forecasts the demand for their own ATMs, it can benefit them in following ways:

• Optimizing the logistic and insurance cost,

• Stabilizing the cash freeze,

• Improving the customer goodwill and so on.
